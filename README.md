Tasked with creating a finance calculator using vanilla JS this is my first attempt at the task.

This was definetly tricky for a few reasons.

The first was being relatively new to javascript there was a lot to learn / unpack with this assignment.

Second some of the instructions seemed a bit vague, was difficult to know if I was on the right track.

The main area of difficulty however was the maths, to say maths isn't my strong suit would be an understatement. However now I know it will be required at certain points I will brush up on it. Fun project that I will be re attempting over the holidays, however definetly challenging.

UPDATE:
Had issues with the deployment of the last repository so after starting the project again from scratch I deleted the old repository and created a new one. I attempted the project from scratch as I'm going through all the assignments from the start of my EDX course and redoing them to solidify the knowledge and adddress any gaps/weaknesses in what I have learnt, preparing myself as much as possible for interview assesments.
